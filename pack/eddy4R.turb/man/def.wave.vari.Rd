\arguments{
\item{spec01}{Waves package output object spectrum, continuous wavelet transform output object complex spectrum for the first variable (typically w' ==> "veloZaxsHor")denoted as \code{object1@spectrum}.}

\item{spec02}{Waves package output object spectrum, continuous wavelet transform output object complex spectrum for the second variable for cospectra denoted as \code{object2@spectrum}.}

\item{scal}{Waves package output object scale, width of the wavelet at each scale [s] denoted as \code{object1@scale}}

\item{prd}{Waves package output object period, approximate corresponding Fourier period [s] denoted as \code{object1@period}}

\item{FreqSamp}{numeric, that determines the time series objects points}

\item{FreqCut}{vector, half-power frequencies for individual variables [Hz] for determining transfer function to correct frequency response}

\item{SetPrd}{numeric, which wavelengths/spatial scales to consider if you want to only consider high frequency values}

\item{CoefNorm}{numeric, normalization factor specific to the choice of Wavelet parameters.}

\item{qfWave}{Wavelet flag: process (0) or not (1)}

\item{paraStbl}{stability parameter (numeric)}

\item{MethSpec}{spectrum or cospectrum  c("spec", "cosp")}

Definition function. Function to determine the temporally resolved variance/covariance from continuous wavelet transform including high-frequency spectral correction and selectable low-frequency cutoff.
